# oldHomework
Uploading a sample of some old homework so people can see how I code (although, at work or in groups I would actually try to make my code a lot cleaner)
I have worked with C++, Python, Java, Matlab, Oracle SQL, and Armv7 Assembly for my classes. In Python I have worked with pandas, numpy, and Jupyter Notebooks. 
I hope this diversity of languages and work serves to show how adaptable I am to work in any language and any environment in a short time frame
