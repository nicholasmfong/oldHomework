SCU's Computer Vision (CV) 2 class was a very hands on class based on the pyimagesearch textbook (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/). This class had little homework, but culminated in a final project. My project was to using convolutional neural networks to predict someone's age from a picture of their face.
